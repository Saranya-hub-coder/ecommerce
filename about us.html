        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos after he relocated from New York City to Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado.[23] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos's house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994.[24] The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.</p>
      
        <h1>Retail Goods</h1>
        <p>Amazon product lines include (books, DVDs, music CDs, videotapes, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal-care items, industrial and scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry and watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items and toys/games. It contains 350 millions of products.

            The company launched amazon.com Auctions, a web auction service, in March 1999. However, it failed to chip away at the large market share of the industry pioneer, eBay. Later, the company launched a fixed-price marketplace business, zShops, in September 1999, and the now defunct partnership with Sotheby's, called Sothebys.amazon.com, in November. Auctions and zShops evolved into Amazon Marketplace, a service launched in November 2000 that let customers sell used books, CDs, DVDs, and other products alongside new items. As of October 2014, Amazon Marketplace is the largest of its kind, followed by similar marketplaces from Sears, Rakuten, and Newegg.
            
            In August 2007, Amazon announced AmazonFresh, a grocery service offering perishable and nonperishable foods. Customers could have orders delivered to their homes at dawn or during a specified daytime window. Delivery was initially restricted to residents of Mercer Island, Washington, and was later expanded to several ZIP codes in Seattle proper.[1] AmazonFresh also operated pick-up locations in the suburbs of Bellevue and Kirkland from summer 2007 through early 2008.
            
            In 2012, Amazon announced the launch of Vine.com for buying green products, including groceries, household items, and apparel.[2] It is part of Quidsi, the company that Amazon bought in 2010 that also runs the sites Diapers.com (baby), Wag.com (pets), and YoYo.com (toys).[2] Amazon also owns other e-commerce sites like Shopbop.com, Woot.com, and Zappos.com.[2]
            
            Amazon's Subscribe & Save program offers a discounted price on selected items (usually ones often reordered), free standard shipping on every Subscribe & Save shipment (starting from the second order), and automatic shipment of the item every two to six weeks or one to six months.[3]
            
            In 2013, Amazon launched its site in India, Amazon. in. It started with electronic goods.[4] In July 2014, Amazon said it would invest $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) in India to expand the business after its largest Indian rival Flipkart announced $1 billion in funding.[5]
            
            In 2014, Amazon sold 63% of all books bought online and 40% of all books sold overall.[6]
            
            In 2015, a study by Survata found that 44% of respondents searching for products went directly to Amazon.com.[7][8]
            
            On September 30, 2015, Amazon announced the launch of Merch by Amazon, a service intended to help content creators generate revenue through the sale of branded T-shirts and other merchandise items such as long sleeve shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies and PopSockets grips, designed by creators and sold, produced and fulfilled by Amazon.[9] Since the summer of 2018, the service has also been available on the European marketplaces in Germany and Great Britain.[10] In June 2022, the service was renamed Amazon Merch on Demand.[11]
            
            In October 2015, Amazon announced a new handmade marketplace called Handmade By Amazon, which already has 5,000 sellers from 60 countries and 80,000 items for sale. The platform is designed for artisans to sell their goods directly to the public, similar to the platform Etsy.[12]
            
            In September 2020, Amazon launched Luxury Stores on its mobile app, where Oscar de la Renta became the first and only label to partner with the firm.[13]</p> 
            <h1>Amazon Prime</h1> 
            <img src="prime.png">
            <p>In 2005, Amazon announced the creation of Amazon Prime, a membership offering free two-day shipping within the contiguous United States on all eligible purchases for a flat annual fee of $79 (equivalent to $123 in 2023),[14] as well as discounted one-day shipping rates.[15] Amazon launched the program in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom in 2007; in France (as "Amazon Premium") in 2008, in Italy in 2011, in Canada in 2013,[16] and in India on July 26, 2016.[17]

                Amazon Prime membership in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, and the United States also provides Amazon Video,[18] the instant streaming of selected movies and TV shows at no additional cost.[19] In November 2011, it was announced that Prime members have access to the Kindle Ownersâ€™ Lending Library, which allows users to borrow certain popular Kindle e-books for free reading on Kindle hardware, up to one book a month, with no due date.[20]
                
                In March 2014, Amazon announced an increase in the annual membership fee for Amazon Prime, from $79 to $99 for customers in the United States.[14][21] Shortly after this change, Amazon announced Prime Music, a service in which members can get unlimited, ad-free streaming of over a million songs and access to curated playlists.[22] In November 2014, Amazon added Prime Photos, which allows unlimited photo storage in the users' Amazon Drive.[23] Amazon also began offering free same-day delivery to Prime members in 14 United States metropolitan areas in May 2015.[24]
                
                On July 15, 2015, to commemorate its 20th birthday, Amazon celebrated "Amazon Prime Day", which Amazon announced would feature deals for prime members that rivaled those on Black Friday.[25]
                
                In January 2016, Amazon Prime reached 54 million members according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.[26]
                
                On September 30, 2016, Amazon subsidiary Twitch announced premium features that are exclusive to users who have an active Amazon Prime subscription (Twitch Prime), including advertising-free access to the service, and monthly offers of video games and add-on content.[27]
                
                In December 2016, Amazon began offering the option of monthly payment for Prime memberships.</p>
